                   Many ideas came to our mind when designing a solution for this specific challenge. But we quickly settled for a solution aligned with our strengths and interests. Explaining data such as the effects of geomagnetic storms on Earth can be exhausting and overwhelming. Therefore, we chose a more practical approach. We decided to develop a web page that could graphically represent the path that these storms took during May 2024. On what platform? We weren’t sure yet, but we knew that we wanted to provide users with the ability to choose the date and time of day for when these storms hit the Earth.

                   For our website, we chose a more minimalistic approach. We wanted to provide users with enough content about the subject at hand, while at the same time, we didn’t want to overwhelm them with options or information. We designed it in such a way that a model of Earth would take the spotlight at the center once users reached our website. We designed this model to display the data that was collected by NASA. As previously mentioned, users would be allowed to manipulate the date of when these storms were active on Earth. That’s why we added a slide bar, for users to see the changes Earth went through in real time.
