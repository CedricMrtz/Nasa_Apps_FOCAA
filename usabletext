From may 3rd onwards 
May 3rd - 9th 82 notable solar flares were observed coming from 2 regions of the sun called “AR13663” and “AR13664”
It was on the 6th that the most intense flare occurred, being of a X4.5 intensity
It was on May 10th and May 11th when aurora borealis became visible on some regions of the planet (some of them including the United States, Mexico, Jamaica, Spain, Algeria, Africa, etc.).
     This happened as a result of the CMEs bunching up, traveling at a speed of 3 million mph creating a long lasting geomagnetic storm that reached a rating of G5, being the highest level on the geomagnetic storm scale.
It was on May 10th when the strongest aurorae displayed itself, illuminating the night sky all around the globe.
The storm negatively affected ground-based broadcasting and two-way communications, more specifically on the high frequency band. Some devices such as the “John Deere RTK GPS” were acting on a degraded state, reporting locations inaccurately
